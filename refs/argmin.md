Returns the paired value associated with the lowest number. The aggregator takes two arguments. The first argument is the number used for the ordering. The second argument is the paired valued, one of them being returned.

```envision
table T = with
  [| as A, as B |]
  [| 2,   "c"   |]
  [| 0,   "a"   |]
  [| 1,   "b"   |]

V = argmin(T.A, T.B)

show scalar "T.B value at lowest T.A" with V
```
