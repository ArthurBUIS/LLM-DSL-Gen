## percentile(T.a : number; b : number) ðŸ¡’ number, aggregator

Returns the value below which the given percentage of observations in the group of observations falls. The second argument must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive). If the percentage falls between two observations, interpolates linearly between the two.

```envision
table T = with
  [| as A |]
  [| 0 |]
  [| 0 |]
  [| 1 |]
  [| 2 |]

show summary "" a1a4 with
  percentile(T.A; 0.25)
  percentile(T.A; 0.50)
  percentile(T.A; 0.75)
  percentile(T.A; 1.0)
```

## percentile(T.a : week; b : number) ðŸ¡’ week, aggregator

Returns the value below which the given percentage of observations in the group of observations falls. The second argument must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive). If the percentage falls between two observations, interpolates linearly between the two.

## percentile(T.a : month; b : number) ðŸ¡’ month, aggregator

Returns the value below which the given percentage of observations in the group of observations falls. The second argument must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive). If the percentage falls between two observations, interpolates linearly between the two.

```envision

## percentile(T.a : text; b : number) ðŸ¡’ text, aggregator

Returns the value below which the given percentage of observations in the group of observations falls. The second argument must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Observations are sorted in lexicographical order. If the percentage falls between two observations, the lower of the two is taken.

```envision
