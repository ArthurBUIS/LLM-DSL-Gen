## arground(a: number) ðŸ¡’ number, pure function

Returns the answer to the question _at what point the trailing 1 becomes too small to be worth printing?_, or worse, becomes smaller than the precision of floating-point numbers.

The rule is as follows: if we find `000` or `999` in the decimal expansion of a number, then it should be rounded for display. `arground(5.3001)` and `arground(5.2998)` return 4, suggesting to keep all 4 digits after the decimal point, but `arground(5.30001)` and `arground(5.29998)` return 1, suggesting that to present these numbers as 5.3.  Thus, 5.3001 stays 5.3001; 5.30001 would become 5.3; 5.2998 stays 5.2998; 5.29998 becomes 5.3.
