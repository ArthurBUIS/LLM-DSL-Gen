## sliceSearchUrl(script: number, pattern: text, tab: text) ðŸ¡’ text, pure function

Returns the [URL](../../stu/url/), encoded as a text value, that points to a specific slice within the latest dashboard produced by a script.

The dashboard is identified by its script identifier passed as the first argument `script`.

The slice is identified by the second argument `pattern`, which acts as a query performed on the dashboard. If there are multiple matching slices, the first slice (name-wise) is selected.

If a tab exists that matches the third agument `tab`, then that tab is opened.

Example:

```envision
projectId = 12345 // found in the URL of the project

table Queries = with
  [| as Q |]
  [| "pant" |]
  [|  "hat" |]
  [|  "cap" |]

Queries.Url = sliceSearchUrl(projectId, Queries.Q)

show table "" a1c3 with
  Queries.Q { href: #[Queries.Url] }
```
