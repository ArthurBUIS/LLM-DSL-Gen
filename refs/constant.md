## constant(a : number) ðŸ¡’ zedfunc, pure function

Returns the `zedfunc` representing the constant function $f: x \mapsto a$.

```envision
show scalar "" a1b2 with constant(1)
```

The `constant()` function should not be confused with the `const` keyword. The two constructs are unrelated. In particular, `constant` does not refer to any kind of compile-time constants.
