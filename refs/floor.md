## floor(a: number) ðŸ¡’ number, const autodiff pure function

Returns the number rounded down to the nearest integer.

```envision

y = floor(x)
show scalar "" with y
```

The gradient associated to `floor()` is 1, instead of 0, as the mathematical definition would suggest. The purpose of this irregular behavior is to facilate the design of discrete policies.
