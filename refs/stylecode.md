Envision contains a sub-language called StyleCode, specifically dedicated to dealing with tiles appearance. It allows to precisely set up the style of all elements contained in a tile. StyleCode's snippets can be easily introduced within an Envision code, inside curly brackets and using semicolons to delimit attributes (e.g., `{textColor: tomato; unit: "â‚¬"}`).

Furthermore, There is a possibility to define custom templates, so called  mixins.  Mixins are identified by an at sign (e.g., `@financial`).

## Hierarchy and properties

A dashboard is primarily divided into **tiles**. Each tile contains some sub-elements such as *title* or *legend*, depending on the tile type. Finally, these ones includes different types of content (e.g. *value* or *name*).

### Tiles

Here is a description of all types of tiles that can appear in a dashboard, along with their supported sub-elements:

* [**assert tile**](/reference/abc/assert): introduced by `show assert`
* [**barchart tile**](/reference/abc/barchart): introduced by `show barchart`
  * [*series*](#sub-elements) of the values to be displayed
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* **chart tile**: introduced by `show chart`
* **error tile**: generated by various `show` statements when placed in invalid conditions
* [**form tile**](/reference/def/form): created with `show form`
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* [**histogram tile**](/reference/ghi/histogram): created with `show histogram`
  * [*series*](#sub-elements) of the values to be displayed
  * [*haxis*](#sub-elements) the horizontal axis that contains a value
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* [**label tile**](/reference/jkl/label): created with `show label`
* [**linechart tile**](/reference/jkl/linechart): created with `show linechart`
  * [*series*](#sub-elements) (time-series) of the values to be displayed; the number of series is statically defined in the script
  * [*legend*](#sub-elements): appears at the bottom of the tile
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* **logo tile**: created with `show logo`
* [**markdown tile**](/reference/mno/markdown): created with `show markdown`
* **menu tile**: created with `show menu`
* [**piechart tile**](/reference/pqr/piechart): created with `show piechart`
  * [*series*](#sub-elements) of values associated to the pie slices
  * [*legend*](#sub-elements): appears to the right of the tile
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* [**plot tile**](/reference/pqr/plot): created with `show plot`
  * [*series*](#sub-elements) of values for each data series
  * [*haxis*](#sub-elements) the horizontal axis that contains a value
  * [*legend*](#sub-elements): appears at the bottom of the tile
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* [**scalar tile**](/reference/stu/scalar): created with `show scalar`
  * [*entry*](#summary-tile): one single pair name-value
* [**scatter tile**](/reference/stu/scatter): created with `show scatter`
  * [*series*](#sub-elements) of values for each data series
  * [*haxis*](#sub-elements) the horizontal axis that contains a value
  * [*legend*](#sub-elements): appears at the bottom of the tile
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* [**slicepicker tile**](/reference/stu/slicepicker): created with `show slicepicker`
* [**summary tile**](/reference/stu/summary): created with `show summary`
  * [*entry*](#summary-tile): the number of entries is statically defined in the script 
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* [**table tile**](/reference/stu/table): created with `show table`
  * [*column*](#sub-elements): the number of columns is statically defined in the script; all rows are displayed, including headers;
   <!-- and **totals** lines;  -->
  * [*title*](#sub-elements) of the tile
* **tabs tile**: created with `show tabs`
* [**treemap tile**](/reference/stu/treemap): created with `show treemap`
* [**upload tile**](/reference/stu/upload): created with `show upload`

 <!-- (dynamically determined during script execution) -->

### Sub-elements

Most tiles contain *data vectors* defined in the `with` section of the Envision script. They are called _columns_ in tables tiles, _entries_ in summary tiles,  while in in other tiles they are called _series_.

* **column** represents a data vector in a table tile, and then supports the property [**as**](#dashboard-layout)
  * *header*: cell at the top of the column, follows the [text pipeline](#text)
  <!-- * *total*: cell at the bottom of the column, containing the calculated total; follows the [number pipeline](#numbers) or the [date pipeline](), as well as the [text pipeline](#text) -->
  * *value* to be displayed; follows the [number pipeline](#numbers) or the [date pipeline](#date), as well as the [text pipeline](#text)
* **entry**: a combination of a value and its name; for [**summary**](#summary-element) tiles, it corresponds to a data vector and so supports the [**as**](#dashboard-layout) property
  * *name* displays the name of the entry, follows the [text pipeline](#text)
  * *value* displays the name of the entry; follows the [number pipeline](#numbers) or the [date pipeline](#date), as well as the [text pipeline](#text)
* **legend**: displays associations between series and their colors or values
* **series**: represents a data vector, supports the [**as**](#dashboard-layout) property and follows the [plot color pipeline](#plot-color)
  * *value* to be displayed; follows the [number pipeline](#numbers) or the [date pipeline](#date), as well as the [text pipeline](#text)
* **title** follows the [text pipeline](#text)
* **haxis**: The first data column of chart tiles is describing horizontal values, and has special stylecode properties that can tune it.


## List of properties

A full list of stylecode properties is available [here](/specifications/stylecode/properties).
We provide there an overview of all properties that can be tuned through StyleCode to customize elements appearance.
Each element inherits all the properties specified for its parent, which can then be overwritten by specifying different values for the element.
