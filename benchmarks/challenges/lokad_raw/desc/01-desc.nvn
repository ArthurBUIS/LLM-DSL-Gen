///The desc keyword is an option for a process call. When desc is present, the ordering of the iteration is inverted.
///When the scan takes a tuple, the desc option can be indepently applied to every element of the tuple, i.e. scan [a desc, b, c desc].

///The desc keyword is an option for a table tile block. When desc is present, the ordering of the table is inverted.
///When the order by takes a tuple as argument, the desc keyword can remain outside the tuple: order by [a, b, c] desc
///or applied individually inside the tuple to offer an ordering control over each element that makes the tuple: order by [a desc, b, c desc].

///Considering the table Items as given below, display the table sorted by Cost in descending order

show table "Items" with
  Items.Item
  Items.Cost
  order by [Items.Cost desc] //do not forget the square brackets [] except if the order by has only one vector
