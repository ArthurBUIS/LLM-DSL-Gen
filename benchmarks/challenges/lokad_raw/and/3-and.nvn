# ANSWER

The A value is the average of the Price column when the price is less than 70,000 and the size is less than or equal to 7. Thus, A = (10k + 11k + 45k) / 3 = 22k
The B value is the average of the Price column when the price is greater than or equal to 20,000 and the color is not gold. Thus, B = (100k + 45k ) / 2 = 72500
The value C is the average of the Price column. Thus, C = (10k + 11k + 60k + 100k + 45k + 70k) / 6 = 98666,66
