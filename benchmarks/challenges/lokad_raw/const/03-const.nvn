///03-Const

///The const keyword indicates that the value taken by a variable is known at compile time and that
///it won’t change later at runtime. Those variables are primarily intended to control the files
///being read.
///Consider the stockouts snapshots "/clean/snapshots/Stockouts_YYYY-MM.ion" which contain 3 columns:
/// - a text "UId" uniquely identifying a product
/// - a date "SnapshotDate" tracking when the snapshot file was produced
/// - a boolean "IsOOS" tracking if the product is stocked-out for that period.
///Read the stockout snapshot from two months ago using regular path.
///Display the ratio product stocked-out and the period in a summary.

///ANSWER

const todayMonthMinus2 = month(today())-2 //current month - 2

read "/clean/snapshots/Stockouts_\{todayMonthMinus2}.ion" as Stockouts expect[date] with //date is a secondary dimension for Stockouts based on "SnapshotDate"
  UId: text
  "SnapshotDate" as date : date //must realias the column SnapshotDate to its dimension date
  IsOOS : boolean


show summary "Out of stocked products" with
  same(date) as "Period"
  ratio(Stockouts.IsOOS) as "OSS ratio" {numbers: percent}
