///05-Const
///The const keyword indicates that the value taken by a variable is known at compile time and that
///it wonâ€™t change later at runtime. Those variables are primarily intended to control the files
///being read.
///1. What is the result of the assert test below assuming today is the 15th of December?
///2. Which days of the year 2025 would pass the test?
const fileRead = match dayNum(today()) with
  1 -> "/clean/NewCatalog.ion"
  .. -> "/clean/OldCatalog.ion"

read "\{fileRead}" as _Catalog

show assert "Test" with
  contains(same(Files.Path) when(Files.Alias == "_Catalog"), "New") as "Test"

///ANSWER
///1. The assert "Test" will FAIL. Since it is assumed that today() = December 15th then the filRead const
///evaluates to "/clean/OldCatalog.ion". That file is read as "_Catalog". The assert tests if the
///file aliased "_Catalog" contains "New" in its path. This is NOT the case for "/clean/OldCatalog.ion" hence
///the test is false and the assert tile FAILS.

///2. To pass the assert test, the file read under Alias "_Catalog" must contain "New" in its path.
///That alias is read through the "fileRead" const. The "fileRead" const contains "New" in its path
///when dayNum(today()) is 1. Therefore the test will be passed for each first day of each month in 2025 i.e
///2025-01-01 / 2025-02-01 / 2025-03-01 ... 2025-12-01
