///04-Const (NB: can't be NVN6 because of user def)

///The const keyword indicates that the value taken by a variable is known at compile time and that
///it won’t change later at runtime. Those variables are primarily intended to control the files
///being read.
///Consider two files with the same structure "/clean/ref/Catalog.ion" and "/clean/sim/Catalog.ion" which contain 3 columns:
/// - a text "UId" uniquely identifying a product, it is the primary dimension.
/// - a number "BuyPrice" representing a buying price reference
///The file in /ref/ is the current production file. The file in /sim/ is a simulation file.
///Create a user defined function which will decide which subfolder, ref or sim should be read. The
///sim folder should be read if the today() date of the script is 2024-12-30 else it's should be the
///ref folder being read. Make sure to flag your function as const.

///Read the Catalog file from the correct folder assuming today is 2024-12-30.
///Display the date considered and the average of the BuyPrice found in the file in a summary.

///ANSWER

def const pure folderPath(t: date, date_sim: date) with
  p = if t == date_sim then "/sim" else "/ref"
  return p

const fpath = folderPath(today(), date(2024,12,30))

read "/clean/\{fpath}/Catalog.ion" as Catalog[ref] with
  "UId" as ref : text
  BuyPrice : number

show summary "Out of stocked products" with
  today() as "Date considered"
  avg(Catalog.BuyPrice) as "Avg BuyPrice" {numbers: simple; unit:"€"}
