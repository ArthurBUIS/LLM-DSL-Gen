///01-Const

///The const keyword indicates that the value taken by a variable is known at compile time and that
///it wonâ€™t change later at runtime. Those variables are primarily intended to control the files
///being read.
///Consider the file "/clean/Catalog.ion" which contains 2 columns:
/// - a text "UId" uniquely identifying a product
/// - a date "LaunchDate" tracking when the product was first launched.
///Store the path to the folder in a const variable and read the file using a regular path. Display the table.

///ANSWER

const path = "/clean/" //the path must be declared as a const to be used as a compile-time variable. Path schemas use single quote '' while regular path use double quotes ""
read "\{path}/Catalog.ion" as Catalog[id] with //"id" is the primary dimension of Catalog, based on "UId" in the file
  "UId" as id : text
  LaunchDate : date

show table "Catalog" with
  id as "id"
  Catalog.LaunchDate
