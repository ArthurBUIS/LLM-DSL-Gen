///02-Const

///The const keyword indicates that the value taken by a variable is known at compile time and that
///it wonâ€™t change later at runtime. Those variables are primarily intended to control the files
///being read.
///Consider the file '/clean/tmp1/Catalog.ion' path schema which contains 2 columns:
/// - a text "UId" uniquely identifying a product
/// - a date "LaunchDate" tracking when the product was first launched.
///The path schema is stored in a module "/modules/PathSchemas".
///Store the path to the folder in a const variable and read the file using a path schema. Display the table.

///ANSWER

import "/modules/PathSchemas" as Schemas //modules use the import keyword
const path = '/clean/' //the path must be declared as a const to be used as a compile-time variable. Path schemas use single quote '' while regular path use double quotes ""
read '\{path}/Catalog.ion' as Catalog[id] with //"id" is the primary dimension of Catalog, based on "UId" in the file
  id = Catalog.Uid //type is known from the schema. Realiasing from Uid to id.

show table "Catalog" with
  id as "id"
  Catalog.LaunchDate
