# 05-write - write several files using "partitioned" keyword

## Statement


The keyword "write" introduces a block used to define a section of vectors, associated to a given table,
to be persisted as a flat file stored in file hosting service named BigFiles.
The contextual keyword "partitioned" modifies the behavior of the write block: several files can be written at once.

Consider a table named Products where three vectors are defined :
 - Product
 - Color
 - Price
Store the data in "Products" table into several tables partitioned by "Color" values on BigFiles in a repertory clean.
Use a schema with columns "Product", "Color" and "Price"
Use a path schema with vector "Color" as the one use for partitioning

## Envision Code

table Products = with
  [| as Product, as Color    , as Price |]
  [| "shirt"   , "white,grey", 10.50    |]
  [| "pants"   , "blue"      , 15.00    |]
  [| "hat"     , "red"       , 5.25     |]

schema Products with
  Product : text
  Color : text
  Price : number

schema '/clean/Products_{Color}.ion' with
  schema Products

write Products partitioned as '/clean/Products_{..}.ion'
