# 01-if : basic if ternary operator

## Statement

The if statement introduces a branch block within a user-defined function.
A branch refers to an instruction that tells the computer to execute a different part of a program
rather than executing statements one by one.
Branches are supported by functions through the keywords if .. else if .. else ...

Create a user defined function mySwap taking two scalar arguments x and y.
This pure function returns a table-free tuple containing x and y a specific order.
If x is trictly greater than y then x and y are swapped and the function returns a tuple with y first and x last.
Otherwise x and y are not swapped and the function returns a tuple with x first and y last.

Display the result of applying this function to the two scalars 4 and 2
