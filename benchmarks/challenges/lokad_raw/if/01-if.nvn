# 01-if : basic if ternary operator

## Statement

The ternary operator if-then-else takes a Boolean as first argument,
and two identically typed values as second and third arguments.
The resulting syntax if c then a else b is treated as an expression.

Consider a table named Products where three vectors are defined :
 - Product
 - Color
 - Price

Create a third vector PriceCategory which contains two possible values
- Cheap for products with a Price strictly lower than 5
- Expensive for the other products

Display the table Products with the three original vectors and the new PriceCategory vector

## Envision Code

table Products = with
  [| as Product, as Color    , as Price |]
  [| "shirt"   , "white,grey", 10.50    |]
  [| "pants"   , "blue"      , 15.00    |]
  [| "hat"     , "red"       , 5.25     |]

Products.PriceCategory = if Products.Price < 5 then "Cheap" else "Expensive"

show table "Products" with
  Products.Color
  Products.Price
  Products.Product
  Products.PriceCategory
