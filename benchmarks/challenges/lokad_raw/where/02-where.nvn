# 02-where - Filtering a dimension and several tables

## Statement

The keyword "where" generally denotes a table being filtered in Envision

Consider table named "Products" where three vectors are defined :
 - Product
 - Color
 - Price
And table "Orders" containing columns Orderdate, Id, Product, Qty and Amount.
Rewrite vector "Amount" for hat only, Ref == 3, using column "Price" from "Products" table.

## Envision Code

table Products [Ref] = with
  [| as Ref , as Product, as Color    , as Price |]
  [|    1   , "shirt"   , "white,grey", 10.50    |]

  [|    3   , "hat"     , "red"       , 5.25     |]

table Orders = with
  [| as OrderDate    , as Id , as Product, as Qty      , as Amount |]
  [| date(2024,1,18) ,   1    , "shirt"   ,   1         , 10.50    |]
