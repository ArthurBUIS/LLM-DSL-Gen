# 03-where - Multiple where

## Statement

The keyword "where" generally denotes a table being filtered in Envision

Consider table named "Products" where three vectors are defined :
 - Product
 - Color
 - Price
And table "Orders" containing columns Orderdate, Id, Product, Qty and Amount.
Rewrite vector "Amount" for Ref == 3 (Product == "hat"), and only if Qty sold was greater or equal than 3 by applying 5% discount on Amount


## Envision Code

  [| as Ref , as Product, as Color    , as Price |]

  [|    3   , "hat"     , "red"       , 5.25     |]

table Orders = with
  [| as OrderDate    , as Id , as Product, as Qty      , as Amount |]
  [| date(2024,1,18) ,   1    , "shirt"   ,   1         , 10.50    |]
