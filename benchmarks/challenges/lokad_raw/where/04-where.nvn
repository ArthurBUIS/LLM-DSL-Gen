# 04-where - keep where

## Statement

The keyword "where" generally denotes a table being filtered in Envision.
Using "keep where" also filters one or several but avoiding indentation.

Consider table named "Products" where three vectors are defined :
 - Product
 - Color
 - Price
Remove all occurences of "Ref" == "3" in all tables with "Ref" dimension.
Then display the tables

## Envision Code

table Products [Ref] = with
  [| as Ref , as Product, as Color    , as Price |]
  [|    1   , "shirt"   , "white,grey", 10.50    |]
  [|    2   , "pants"   , "blue"      , 15.00    |]
  [|    3   , "hat"     , "red"       , 5.25     |]

table Orders = with
  [| as OrderDate    , as Id , as Product, as Qty      , as Amount |]
  [| date(2024,1,18) ,   1    , "shirt"   ,   1         , 10.50    |]
