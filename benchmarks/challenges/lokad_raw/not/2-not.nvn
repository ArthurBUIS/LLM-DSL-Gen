## Statement

The keyword 'not 'is used to return the negation of a boolean.

Consider a table named Products where three vectors are defined :
 - Product
 - Color
 - Price
and two tables named Catalog_Store_A and Catalog_Store_B where 2 vectors are defined :
 - Product
 - Stock
The tables Catalog_Store provide the catalog of products available in each store and the related stock available.

Display a table with the products and their prices only if a product appears in the catalog of Store A and not in Store B.
