///The keyword keep has two uses in Envision, either to avoid an identation, or to define the state of a process.
///When the keyword keep appears at the start of a where statement, the filter applies until the end of scope.
///When the keyword keep appears at the start of a span statement, the UNfilter applies until the end of the scope.
///At the beginning of a process block, the variables that are part of the state of the process can be declared with the keyword keep.
///In a for loop that enumerates the values of a column, the keyword keep is used to declare the variables part of the state of the loop.
///Idem, with a each loop, that enumerates the lines of a table

///Consider the table named "Products" with primary dimension "ref" and three additional vectors "Product", "Color", "Price":
/// - ref: uuid of the product, primary dimension of the table
/// - Product: the product type
/// - Color: the color of the product
/// - Price: the unit price of the product
///Consider additionally, the table named "Orders" with primary dimension "orderid" with secondary dimension "ref" and additional vectors "OrderDate", "Qty":
///- ref: uuid of the product, secondary dimension of the table
///- OrderDate: the date at which the product was ordered
